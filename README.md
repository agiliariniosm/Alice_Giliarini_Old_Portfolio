Hi, welcome to my data analysis portfolio!

## Project 1: Webtoon

Webtoon is a company that produces comics which are available for the public to read both online and via a phone app. Each comic has information attached to it such as a single genre tag, a summary, average rating out of 10, total likes across episodes, and the amount of subscribed readers. Such data was collected in the dataset I used, taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/swarnimrai/webtoon-comics-dataset). The dataset looks at 569 "Original" Webtoon comics, or comics that are sponsored by Webtoon, and does not include comics available in Webtoon's "Canvas" section where anyone can post.

For this project I:
- Used SQL to sift through Webtoon's summaries of comics, find most used words, and pull-out keywords
- Used Superset to create a dashboard with charts and tables to visualize outcomes
