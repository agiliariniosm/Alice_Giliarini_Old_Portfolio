Webtoon is a company that produces comics which are available for the public to read both online and via a phone app. Each comic has information attached to it such as a single genre tag, a summary, average rating out of 10, total likes across episodes, and the amount of subscribed readers. Such data was collected in the dataset I used, taken from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/swarnimrai/webtoon-comics-dataset).

For this project I:
- Used SQL to sift through Webtoon's summaries of comics, find most used words, and pull-out keywords
- Used Superset to create a dashboard with charts and tables to visualize outcomes
